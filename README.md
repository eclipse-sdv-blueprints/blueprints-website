## Introduction
The **Eclipse SDV Blueprints** project is a collaborative initiative led by Eclipse SDV members to bring the "software defined vehicle" concepts to life. A crucial aspect of each blueprint is to ensure users can easily reproduce it on their own. This requires well-written and highly clear documentation. Users can utilize blueprints as they are, for inspiration or as a foundation to customize and meet their specific needs.

The Eclipse SDV Blueprints project hosts a collection of blueprints that demonstrate the application of technologies developed within the projects of the Eclipse SDV working group (sdv.eclipse.org). This allows for showcasing the capabilities and features of the software provided by the Eclipse SDV working group, while also exploring collaboration opportunities and integration of these technologies.



**Eclipse Blueprints Website** is build using the Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. Please refer to [https://docusaurus.io/](https://docusaurus.io/) for documentation.
